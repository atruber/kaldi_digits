Overall, AY accounts for 4.9% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (18,18.8,30) frames.
Overall, UW accounts for 2.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (16,17.9,34) frames.
Overall, EY accounts for 2.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (20,20.7,30) frames.
Overall, W accounts for 2.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (17,17.4,28) frames.

Overall, K accounts for 2.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (9,9.5,14) frames.
Overall, Z accounts for 2.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (12,12.5,18) frames.
Overall, TH accounts for 2.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (14,13.8,20) frames.
Overall, AO accounts for 2.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (17,17.5,29) frames.
Overall, EH accounts for 2.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (8,8.3,10) frames.
The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 29.5% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 72.2% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 2.3% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 4.2 hours of data, or 3.0 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 2.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (10,14.4,38)
