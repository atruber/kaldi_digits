Overall, Z accounts for 2.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (14,13.8,20) frames.
Overall, AO accounts for 2.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (19,19.7,33) frames.
Overall, TH accounts for 2.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (14,14.3,23) frames.
The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 29.8% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 73.8% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 4.9% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 2.2 hours of data, or 1.5 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 4.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (13,17.4,41)
